# Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a step-by-step approach to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Predictive Modeling using Python. The notebook uses real-world data to explore insights, clean and preprocess the data, build predictive models, and visualize the results.

## Contents
- **sales_data.csv**:  dataset used for the analysis.
- **Sales_Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for EDA and Predictive Modeling.

## How to Use
Follow these steps to use the notebook:

1. Clone the Repository:

2. Install Required Libraries:
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can use the following command to install them:


3. Open and Run the Jupyter Notebook:


4. Execute the Cells:
- Follow the instructions in the notebook and execute each cell to perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling on the provided dataset.
- Customize the code and analysis to your specific dataset and objectives.

5. Interpret the Results:
- Review the analysis, visualizations, and model performance metrics generated by the notebook to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.

6. Implement Predictive Models:
- If needed, adapt and implement the predictive models for your own datasets by following the code examples provided in the notebook.

## Dependencies
The notebook uses various Python libraries, including:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
